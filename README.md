# Filmotheque

A REST API using C#, EntityFramework and OpenAPI.

## Prerequisites

You'll need :
- Visual Studio 2022 (with "ASP.NET and web development" kit)
- DotNET 7 (download the SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0))

## How to begin

Open the solution (.sln file) using Visual Studio. In case there are compiler errors showing up, you might need to get the NuGet packages; right-click the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages".

## How to use

Build and execute the code. A web page should open with OpenAPI. You can test the API using this page.
The API is currently using Entity Framework's In-Memory system, so restarting the program will reset the data.
